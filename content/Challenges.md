>     1. **6 FPS** :To make 1min video in 6 Fps(Frames per second). 60 * 6 = 360 frames needs to be drawn . also 6 fps is really really bad quality. First video was in 6 fps.
>     2. **12 FPS**:Its mid, but Amount of frames need to make 1min video in 12 fps is insane . 12 * 60 = 720 . so many frames! so much To do ! . The video that is currently given is 12  fps video . Nearly 600 frames have been completed . **Not perfectly**
>     3. **24 FPS**: Standard 2d animation Fps is 24 fps. Quality is excellent. But 24 * 60 = 1440. easy! Right?
