**Narrator** 
Do you know the name of subject of this video 

**Light the stickman**
*shh!*![[1.png]]
(shh! come on screen)
*Don't tell them
what is this why text is not moving* ![[2.png]]
(after touching text all letters except exclamation mark. all letters goes into thin air).![[3.png]]
*Why do I feel like I have seen this somewhere.*
( he intensely stares at exclamation mark try's  to ponder where he has seen the thing in front of ![[4.png]]him i.e. exclamation mark, then he remembers what is in front of him . )
*our familiar E the edge and V the vertex .*

**Scene**
Now exclamation mark fells to the ground
![[5.png]]
**Light the stickman**
(moves to pick the line and  the dot which made ![[6.png]]the exclamation mark. he gets confused about how can he get brace. he try's to say "brace") 
*brace*
(but his words did not come out in physical form he try's to say it louder but still no use)
*BRACEEEE*
( He gets bored and starts to play with line and  vertex .he strikes vertex) 
![[7.png]]
**Scene**
(which bounces of the ground and collides with his body which sends him flying into sky.
![[8.png]]
![[9 1.png]]
**Cuts to :**

**Scene**
He is falling from sky 
![[10.png]]
**Light the stm**
(he then  falls to the ground of a room with roof open. Where there is long machine which has 2 or three buttons . )![[11.png]]
**Scene**
(he pressed the square button on the machine to open the copy paste and delete dialog. he presses on copy option . which results in many lines and vertices being copied so that one output box gets filled .)![[13.png]]
(He then moves to another machine on floor. device which takes lines and vertices to make it into desired symbol . ![[15.png]]while trying to replicate desired symbol he navigates to correct symbol And presses the button resembling brace symbol. But braces didn’t come out . instead screen started showing 4 symbols and 6 numbers continuously )
(He wonders if there is some anomaly in the machine) 
(it looks like some malfunction or some mysterious thing is trying to hack terminals ,after some time of continuous flickering of symbols  . screen becomes blur . smoke start coming from machine. But there is no explosion only the sound of metal panel getting removed was heard and we see two sets of eyes and bunch of symbols and letters escaping from other side.) 

**Light the stm**
Now he goes to machine to check if everything but he founds nothing. he kicks the machine out of frustration but it hurts him so he comes out of room of machines to normal room including a pc . some other tools. moves to box where lines and vertices are stored. 

Light the stm
*See this , this is a bin full of lines can be called as a set with one element repeated several times , for sake of notations we will call this set as set A and now if we combine this set with this bin of vertices aka set B and. We name this combined set as Set C having two unique elements. Our set A here is element of set c*
Scene: screen turns to black

**Narrator**
(but why? It was not in the script)
*Hey what happened why screen is black.*
*I am turning it back to white*

**Light the stm**
*No!***

**Scene**
(We can see him bending line in u shape )

**Light the stm**
( He picks another line and attaches to u shape to make subset symbol)
*Now if we put this symbol in between A and C we can call it as a Set A is subset of set C and if we reverse it we get concept of super set. We call set c as super set of A*

**Not refined** 
Light the stm 
*This set c has a has fancy name in graph theory.it is called as a graph and set A is called set of Edges.and B is called set of vertices*
(Now he carry's some line and vertices to middle of room)
He hold one vertex to show 



When he pick the brace he sees he sees three dots vertically after seeing dots he knocks on main screen with hand .
Narrator: what is it? Why you are disturbing me.
Can you move the brace up  where you 
Narrator: Ok fine I will give you a object which will make this easier. 
( Now that object appears )(He attached to brace and then dialogue box appears listing different functions and properties )
 lift at certain heights. Then he starts explaining 
*These lines in this box represents set *
