>[! tip] GRAPH THEORY 

**self loop**: Edge having same initial and terminal vertex.
```
  In graph G1, e4 is self loop
  ```
  
**parallel edges**: Two distinct edges having same initial and terminal vertices are called parallel edges.
```
  In graph G1, e2 and e3 are parallel edges.
  ```

**Simple graph**: A Graph without self loop and parallel edges is called simple graph
```
Graph G2 is simple graph
```

**MultiGraph**: A graph having self loop and parallel edges is called Multigraph.
```
Graph G1 is Multigraph 
```

**Degree of vertex**: Number of edges incident on vertex V is called degree of vertex V.
```
It is denoted by d(V) ordeg(V)
In graph G2, d(v3)= 2
```

**Even vertex**: A vertex whose degree is even is called even vertex.
```
In graph G2, v2 is even vertex
```

**Odd vertex**: A vertex whose degree is odd is called odd vertex.
```
In graph G2, v4 is odd vertex 
```
