> [!abstract] theme

Following are the things that should be in script:
- It must start in some amusing way .
- main theme should be #graphtheory combine with another subjects like : 
     1. Other Fields of Mathematics.
     2. Physics (Good for long term)
     3. Law (Not good for long term)
     4. Technology  ( will be so much complex to animate)
     5. Games ( More complex than Tech )
    These are the only ones I know 
- English has to be only language in the video.
- Script must not be boring and must not be too much complex.
- It must be of such nature if animated it will look good on screen 
- **I will add other conditions . If I learn new things**
