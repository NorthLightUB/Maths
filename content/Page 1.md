>[!tip] GRAPH THEORY 

**Graph**: A graph G is an ordered pair(V, E) where V is the set of vertices and E is the set of edges
```
  We will denote graph G(V,E) or G(P,Q).Where
    P: No. Of vertices 
    Q: No. Of edges. 
  ```

**Adjacent Vertices**:Vertices U and V are said to be adjacent if there is an edge joining the vertices u and v.
```
  In graph G v1 and v2 are adjacent vertices but v1 and v3 are non adjacent vertices 
```
**Adjacent Edges**:When two edges e & f are incident on a common vertex then they are called adjacent edges
```
  In graph G2, e1 and e2 are adjacent edges 
  In graph G2, e5 and e8 are non adjacent edges
  ```
